Theorem normal_forms_unique:
  deterministic normal_form_of.
Proof.
  unfold deterministic. unfold normal_form_of.  intros x y1 y2 P1 P2.
  inversion P1 as [P11 P12]; clear P1. inversion P2 as [P21 P22]; clear P2. 
  generalize dependent y2. 
  (* We recommend using this initial setup as-is! *)
  exact GIVEUP.
Qed.
