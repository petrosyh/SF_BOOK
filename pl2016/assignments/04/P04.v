(** **** Problem #3 : 2 stars, advanced (currying) *)
(** In Coq, a function [f : A -> B -> C] really has the type [A
    -> (B -> C)].  That is, if you give [f] a value of type [A], it
    will give you function [f' : B -> C].  If you then give [f'] a
    value of type [B], it will return a value of type [C].  This
    allows for partial application, as in [plus3].  Processing a list
    of arguments with functions that return functions is called
    _currying_, in honor of the logician Haskell Curry.

    Conversely, we can reinterpret the type [A -> B -> C] as [(A *
    B) -> C].  This is called _uncurrying_.  With an uncurried binary
    function, both arguments must be given at once as a pair; there is
    no partial application. *)

(** We can define currying as follows: *)

Print prod_curry.

(** As an exercise, define its inverse, [prod_uncurry].  Then prove
    the theorems below to show that the two are inverses. *)

Definition prod_uncurry {X Y Z : Type}
  (f : X -> Y -> Z) (p : X * Y) : Z :=
  GIVEUP.

(** (Thought exercise: before running these commands, can you
    calculate the types of [prod_curry] and [prod_uncurry]?) *)

Check @prod_curry.
Check @prod_uncurry.

Example test_uncurry:
  prod_uncurry plus (3,7) = 10.
Proof. exact GIVEUP. Qed.

Theorem uncurry_curry : forall (X Y Z : Type) (f : X -> Y -> Z) x y,
  prod_curry (prod_uncurry f) x y = f x y.
Proof.
  exact GIVEUP.
Qed.

Theorem curry_uncurry : forall (X Y Z : Type)
                               (f : (X * Y) -> Z) (p : X * Y),
  prod_uncurry (prod_curry f) p = f p.
Proof.
  exact GIVEUP.
Qed.
