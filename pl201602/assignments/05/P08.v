(** Recall that functions returning propositions can be seen as
    _properties_ of their arguments. For instance, if [P] has type
    [nat -> Prop], then [P n] states that property [P] holds of [n].

    Drawing inspiration from [In], write a recursive function [All]
    stating that some property [P] holds of all elements of a list
    [l]. To make sure your definition is correct, prove the [All_In]
    lemma below.  (Of course, your definition should _not_ just
    restate the left-hand side of [All_In].) *)

Fixpoint All {T} (P : T -> Prop) (l : list T) : Prop :=
  FILL_IN_HERE.

Lemma All_In :
  forall T (P : T -> Prop) (l : list T),
    (forall x, In x l -> P x) <->
    All P l.
Proof. exact FILL_IN_HERE. Qed.
