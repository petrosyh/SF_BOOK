(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, advanced (value_is_nf)  *)
(** Hint: You will reach a point in this proof where you need to
    use an induction to reason about a term that is known to be a
    numeric value.  This induction can be performed either over the
    term itself or over the evidence that it is a numeric value.  The
    proof goes through in either case, but you will find that one way
    is quite a bit shorter than the other.  For the sake of the
    exercise, try to complete the proof both ways. *)
