(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, advanced (pup_to_n)  *)
(** Write an Imp program that sums the numbers from [1] to
   [X] (inclusive: [1 + 2 + ... + X]) in the variable [Y].
   Prove that this program executes as intended for [X] = [2]
   (the latter is trickier than you might expect). *)

Theorem pup_to_2_ceval :
  pup_to_n / (t_update empty_state X 2) \\
    t_update (t_update (t_update (t_update (t_update (t_update empty_state
      X 2) Y 0) Y 2) X 1) Y 3) X 0.
Proof. exact FILL_IN_HERE. Qed.
